**The fully functional test system is delivered by**  **april/may**  **2020.**

The system must be delivered in a state that is ready for use in the intended production environment for the intended purpose. Users will receive the necessary training to begin using the system. We will consider both of these objectives achieved if users who plan to use the system during the test period complete the attached Acceptance Test Users Survey.

**The concerns raised in the trial period are addressed based on the troubleshooting plan contained in the software project management plan**

All defects will be resolved or at least addressed to be rectified. A critical defect is a defect for which there is no convenient solution. In addition to the correction of defects, the required changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Users will be informed of their rights and responsibilities under this policy before the start of the acceptance test.

**Users**  **can easily log into the system.**

This means in particular that a User will be able to select the access option, type his first and last name or part of his first and/or last name, select events and press a confirmation button.

**EG Service**  **supervisors can edit events in the system calendar.**

Specifically, a volunteer or officer will be able to login to the system, select the calendar option, and add or remove special events. Also, this means that they will be able to control the events available for daily users.

**EG Service**  **supervisors can create and edit user accounts.**

This includes officer and users accounts. Data should be editable from the Internet interface.

**The production database is updated.**

Data from PAL&#39;s existing database is uploaded to the new system. Data from all fields in the existing database shall be migrated to corresponding fields in the new database..

**EG Service**  **supervisors can print all the reports**

These reports must be in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the data correctly displayed. The data in the report should accurately re ect what is saved on our servers.

**The System is documented.**

The user manual is included. This manual should be easy to understand for non-technical users who are familiar with the basic concepts of the Internet, the manual only explains how to use all the features of the system. The system manual is included. This system manual contains the architecture document, as well as any additional material necessary to provide a technician with all the information needed to maintain and update the system.

**Known defects are entered into the location system**

The defects detected but not immediately settled will be entered into the tracking system. At the end of the project there must be no unresolved defects.
