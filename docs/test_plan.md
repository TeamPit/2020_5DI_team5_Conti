# 1 Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the Eg Service websit. As outlined in the project Requirements Document, this system needs to provide every person interested in being able to view ,buy any type of overhead door, door, window and much more.

This system will also provide a mechanism for discussion amongst providers and clients affiliated with the providers. The testing activities discussed in this document will verify that the software for the Question and Answer system meets the needs of the customer by verifying that the requirements for this system, as outlined in the Requirements Document, are met.

The testing routine will test the Question and Answer system&#39;s response to asking a question, browsing through previously asked questions, searching through questions/answers by keyword, logging in to front-end/back-end websites and posting answers to the front-end website. The results of this testing procedure will enable the creators of this system to gauge project success as outlined in the Macro Project Plan.

# 2 Terminology

Throughout this document the terms user, clients, provider, site and username/password will be used frequently therefore, formal definitions will be given.

User- people who can only see the and use the front end website

Provider- employees who will help oversee and are involved in this website

Clients- affiliated user who can also use the system to discuss with the providers

Site- the front-end website

Username/Password- unique identifiers that authenticate and validates a user

# 3 Items Tested

Items that will be tested during the testing phase as laid out by the Macro Project Plan will be but are not limited to:

- Ability for a client to login via username and password to the website

- Ability for a user to signing in the web site

- Ability for a client view the articles on the website

- Ability for a client to send a messages to the providers

# 4 Items Not Tested

There are features that will not be included in the current testing procedure. This does not mean that these features will not be implemented, but that they have not been implemented and are not available for testing. Those features include but are not limited to:

- Buy any article from the website

# 5 Approach

The overall method to this testing procedure is manual system testing. Each test case created will have a direct link to the requirements as laid out in the Requirements Document. Test cases that include similar Feature methods will be tested together. Examples of these features include logging in to submit a question, logging in to submit a survey and/or logging in to the back-end website. Test cases such as these test the security features of the system along with the ability to submit information to the database. Each test case will test the security feature with invalid and valid data (usernames and passwords) to ensure that user requirement of valid users for these features is met.

Manual system testing will continue throughout the second and third iteration of the project. For each iteration, both old and newly implemented features will be tested. Adding new features or functionality can sometimes interfere with the functionality of old features and to ensure product/project success, all features implemented should function as intended throughout the life of the software.


# 6 Item Pass/Fail Criteria

The minimum requirements for this software system were laid out in the Requirements Document and the Macro Project Plan outlined what the creators of the software considered project success.

Implemented features that meet the requirements as determined by the customer, meaning the feature does what the user wants it to do with very little difficulty, passes the testing procedure. Difficulty, as used here, is determined by user comprehension and user ability to use the feature with little to no training.

Features that contain major defects will fail the testing procedure and will be documented via an incident report and turned over to the developer for investigation and revision.


# 7 Test Deliverables

In addition to the Test Plan, other test deliverables include the Test Specification which outlines the specific test cases and expected results of each test, and Test reports which is comprised of Incidents, Defects and Changes.
