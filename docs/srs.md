## 1. <a id="introduction"></a> Introduction

### 1.1 _Overview_

The **OnGo** is an application that provides you access to all the files stored on your personal computer from _any device_ you want.

This document provides informations on the requirements for the **OnGo** application.  
Project goals, scope and definitions are given in the _introduction_.  
_Design constraints_ and _application environment_ are described in the following section.  
_Nonfunctional requirements_ are outlined for later verification.  
_Functional requirements_ are given to show the system features and expected user interaction.  
The _Software Project Management Plan_ will give specifics on project budget and schedule.

### 1.2 _Goals and Objectives_

The **main objective** of this project is to allow users to have an easy and quick access to any file stored on other devices. The OnGo application is expected to: 

* function in an **simple and intuitive** manner
* provide an **easy access** to the user's files without   uploading them first, as cloud services require to.
* work on **any** operative system and device

### 1.3 _Definitions_

> **Origin** - It's the computer on which files are _actually_ stored, your "_home pc_" if you want to.

> **User** - It's the person that's trying to get to the _origin_ via OnGo

## 2. <a id="gdc"></a> General Design Constrains

### 2.1 _Application Environment_

The OnGo product includes:

* A **desktop application** of our design that has to be installed on the _origin_ system
* A **web application** of our design that is used by the _user_ to interact with his own registered _origin_ system

Both applications interact with our [Web Api](https://us-central1-web-ftp-ongo.cloudfunctions.net/api) that will handle the communications between the **user** and the corresponding **origin**. 

### 2.2 _User Characteristics_

Users will need to have a valid [account]() in order to download the **OnGo origin program** and they will also need to use their accounts to log into the **user web application** in order to use it. There is _no limitation_ on the device that the user can use.

### 2.3 _Mandated Constrains_

The whole system has to work via HTTP connection (https). This is mandatory because the _origin_ machine will probably be inside a private network and it might not be allowed to host a server accessible from the public internet due to several security issues or privacy policies. 

## 3. <a id="nfr"></a> Nonfunctional Requirements

### 3.1 _Operational Requirements_

The **user web application** has to provide an easy to use interface and should be simple enough to let every user connect to it's own origin without any serious problems.

The **origin main application** has to generate and give the code to the user in the most clear way possible. The user will still need to remember that code by himself.

### 3.2 _Performance Requirements_

### 3.3 Security Requirements

### 3.4 _Documentation and Training_

The OnGo application _itself_ will not include any documentation or training for the final user but video tutorials will be available on the [team website]() and on the official [YouTube channel]().
