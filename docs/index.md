OnGo is an application built to give ​_everyone __​_the possibility to access their personal files and data in ​_real time__ ​_and from ​_any location and device __​_. The OnGo application is a simple Web App that allows you to ​_remotely control__ ​_your computer and to ​_directly __access__ ​_all the files stored. Unlike Google Drive, OneDrive or iCloud, OnGo​_doesn&#39;t keep any file stored __​_in the cloud and doesn&#39;t need any upload action by the user tomake it available. Our product works as a ​_link__ ​_between your home computer or work laptop maybe and the device that you want to use to connect to it, recovering all the needed files ​_on user request__​_and automatically downloading them on the new device. All your data available on any device, this time for real.
